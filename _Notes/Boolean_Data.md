## Inheritance

In the previous lesson, we have shown that we can reuse the code from some *base* class by using inheritance. The syntax in Python for deriving a class from some base class is as follows:

```python
class NameSubClass(NameBaseClass):
    pass
```

The name of the parent class or the base class is specified in the parenthesis after the class name. By specifying this, the child class inherits all the *attributes* and *methods* of the parent class. So what do we define in the child class? We can define the following things:
- attributes and methods that are unique to the child class
- methods in the parent's class that we want to override

One example that we had in the previous lesson is to create the class `VertexSearch` from the class `Vertex`. The class `Vertex` has two attributes: `id` and `neighbours`. When the class `VertexSearch` inherits from `Vertex`, any object of `VertexSearch` also has `id` and `neighbours`. What we need to define in the class `VertexSearch` are those attributes not present in the parent class. In this example, `VertexSearch` has additional attributes of `colour`, `distance`, and `parent`. Now, `Vertex` in general will not have these attributes since these are only used when doing a graph search. Similarly, we can also define any additional *methods* in the child class that is present in the parent class. 

Besides defining attributes and methods that are unique to the child class, we can also *re-define* the methods of the parent class. This is what is called as *overriding*. One common method that is usually overridden is the initialization method.

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, id=''):
        self.id = id
        self.neighbours = {}
```

And the class `VertexSearch` can override this initialization:
```python
import sys

class VertexSearch(Vertex):
    def __init__(self, id=""):
        super().__init__(id)
        self.colour = "white"
        self.d = sys.maxsize
        self.f = sys.maxsize
        self.parent = None
```

The first line of the init is to call the *parent* class' initialization and the subsequent lines proceed to initialize those  attributes that is unique to the child class. In this way, we need not re-write all the initialization codes of the parent class and simply re-use them. Note that in overriding a method in the parent class, we use the same method's name and arguments as in the parent class. 

Let's discuss a few more examples of inheritance.

## Fraction and MixedFraction 

Let's say we have a class called `Fraction` which has two attributes: *numerator* and *denominator*. This class also has all the methods to do the operation such as addition and subtraction. With this we can do addition and subtraction of Fraction:

```python
f1 = Fraction(1, 2)
f2 = Fraction(3, 4)
f3 = f1 + f2
f4 = f2 - f1
```

The first line creates a fraction object $1/2$ while the second line creates a fraction object $3/4$. The third line adds these two fractions $1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4$ which is then stored in `f3`. The last line, on the other hand, subtracts these two fractions, $3/4 - 1/2 = 1/4$ which is then stored in f4.

What should we do if we want to do operation with a mixed fraction such as the following?

$$1 \frac{1}{2} + 2\frac{3}{4}$$

Well, we can always represent these mixed fraction as two ordinary fractions

$$\frac{3}{2} + \frac{11}{4}$$

and perform the same fraction operations. However, we do not want to do this manipulation or conversion manually if we can just write a computer code to do so. Therefore, it is worthwhile to create a new class called `MixedFraction` where we can define a fraction that may contain a whole number and additional numerator and denominator. What is different from the `Fraction` class is the way we initialize this object. Using the example above, i.e. $1 \frac{1}{2} + 2\frac{3}{4}$, we want to be able to write in the following manner:

```python
f1 = MixedFraction(1, 2, 1)
f2 = MixedFraction(3, 4, 2)
f3 = f1 + f2
```
Note that we purposely put the whole number as the last argument because we want `MixedFraction` to be able to handle ordinary fraction when the whole number is zero.

```python
f4 = MixedFraction(1, 2) # this is the same as Fraction(1, 2)
```
The UML class diagram can be seen as shown below.

<img src="/assets/images/week6/fraction_mixedfraction.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

In the above UML diagram, we choose not to have any additional attributes but only different initialization arguments. This means that we have to initialize the numerator and the denominator from the three arguments used in the initialization `MixedFraction(top, bottom, whole)`, i.e.

$$numerator = whole \times bottom + top$$

Similarly, there are no methods to do addition and subtraction. The object of `MixedFraction` depends on its parent class' methods to do addition and subtraction. In fact, when Python cannot find the name of a particular method in the child class, it will try to find the same name in the parent class' methods. If no name is matched in the parent class' methods, Python will throw an error saying that such method is not defined.

Moreover, we also choose to implement `__str__()` method which is called whenever Python tries to convert the object to an `str` representation. Notice that we choose to **override** this method in the child class. The reason is that we want `Fraction` and `MixedFraction` to be represented differently as a string. For example, $5/2$ will be represented differently depending whether it is a `Fraction` object or a `MixedFraction` object.

```python
5/2   # str representation of Fraction
2 1/2 # str representation of MixedFraction
```

This is an example of how a parent class' method is overriden in the child class. The name and the argument of the method is the same and yet the behaviour is different in the child class. 

Now, let's look at another example

## Queue and Deque

Another example we can work on is to extend the class `Queue` to implement a new data structure called `Deque` (pronounced as deck). The difference between a `Queue` and a `Deque` is that in `Queue` the item only has one entrance which is from the back of the Queue. The exit of a `Queue` object is at the front of the Queue. On the other hand, a `Deque` can be inserted other from the front or from the rear. Its item also can be popped out from either the front or the rear. Below is the UML representation of the class diagram when `Queue` is implemented using a double Stack.

<img src="/assets/images/week6/queue_deque.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Notice that in the above UML class diagram, we use `/` to represent computed property, i.e. `/size` and `/is_empty`. `Deque` does not have any additional attributes or property. The only changes are the methods. We rename and add additional methods for `Deque` class. In this cass, `add_rear(item)` of `Deque` is the same as `enqueue(item)` of a `Queue` object. Similarly, `remove_front()` method of `Deque` is the same as `dequeue()` of a `Queue` object. This is also true for the case of `peek_front()` and `peek()`. Thus, we need not re-write half of the methods in `Deque` class since we can simply call its parent class' methods. 

## Abstract Base Class

There are cases when the *parent* class only specifies what attributes and methods the child classes should have and in itself contain no implementation. You can think of this as something like the following definition:

```python
class MyAbstractClass:
    def add(self, other):
        pass
    
class ChildOfMyAbstractClass(MyAbstractClass):
    def add(self, other):
        # contains implementation of adding the two objects
        ...
```

In the first class of `MyAbstractClass`, there is a method `add(other)` which contains no definition. This method is overriden by the child class `ChildOfMyAbstractClass`. In this class, `add(other)` is defined and, thus, overridden.

Previously in `MixedFraction` class, we see how the child class' operations depends on the implementation of its parent class' methods. In that case, no `__add__()` nor `__sub__()` is defined in the child class. Therefore any method call to do addition and subtraction will be referred to the parent class implementation. The case of an Abstract class is the opposite of this. When we have an Abstract class with no implementation, we are forcing the implementation to be found in the child class. However, by writing the code as shown above, there is nothing that prevents the child class **not** to implement the required method. 

Python provides some mechanism to ensure that the abstract method in the abstract base class is implemented in the child class. Let's take a look at one example of this using `collections.abc` class. This `collections.abc` class is an Abstract Base Class for containers. For example, if we want to create a new data type belonging to a type `Iterable`, we can inherit this new class from `collections.abc.Iterable`. Python will force the new class to define the method `__iter__()`. Otherwise, Python will throw an error. Let's try it out in the next cell.

```python
import  collections.abc as c

class NotRightIterable(c.Iterable):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

test = NotRightIterable()
```

The output is
```sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-04bbdf83346f> in <module>
      5         self.data = []
      6 
----> 7 test = NotRightIterable()

TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class NotRightIterable with abstract methods __iter__
```
When you run the above cell, Python will complain saying that it cannot instantiate the new class because we did not implement the abstract method `__iter__()`. To fix this, we need to define this method in the child class.

```python
import  collections.abc as c

class RightIterable(c.Iterable):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.data)

test = RightIterable()
```
There will be no error when you run the above cell because now the method `__iter__()` has been implemented in the child class. The definition of `__iter__()` simply returns an iterable object from `self.data`. 

So, we have shown the mechanism where Python ensures that when you create an Abstract Base Class with some abstract methods, the child class must implement this abstract method. Otherwise, Python will throw an exception. In future lessons, we will create our own Abstract Base Class.
