## What is Computational Thinking?
Before we delve into programming, we would like to talk first about computational thinking. Computational thinking has been identified as one of the important work skills in the 21st century. A number of governments have revised their primary education curriculum to include computational thinking for all students. Some argue that computational thinking should be another literacy that must be taught similar to writing and mathematics. So what is computational thinking and how does it relate to programming?

Wing defines computational thinking as taking an approach to solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviours that draws on the concepts fundamental to computing[^1]. Computational thinking's essence is thinking like a computer scientist when confronted with a problem. Computational thinking, in a way, changes the way we think. Computational concepts provide a new language for describing problems and their solutions. To solve problems in the future, we will need to understand computation.

Wing tried to clarified her own definition in saying that "Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are repsented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent"[^2].  This is a rather general statements, but there are a few components highlighted by this definition:
- "thought processes": Computational thinking deals more with the thought processes or the thinking process rather than codes and computer programs. This is why such thinking skills is important for a wider audience than just those who wants to be a programmers.
- "formulating problems and their solutions": Computational thinking focuses on how to solve problems. It is not the ultimate thinking skills needed but rather only one of the  thinking skills that deals with problem solving. Mathematical thinking may provide a different point of few of how to solve problems. Design thinking skills may help someone to generate more ideas and design a solution that emphatise with the users. Yet, computational thinking focuses on problem solving and in a specific way.
- "solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent": This particular emphasis separates computational thinking with any other problem solving thought process. It's a mouthful and some people have tried to simplify those words. Aho simplified it to "solutions that can be represented as computational steps and algorithms"[^3] (Aho 2012). This is how computational thinking is closely related to programming.

## Components of Computational Thinking

There are many attempts to identify the elements of computational thinking. For example, Grover listed the following as important elements in computational thinking[^4]:
- abstraction and pattern generalization
- systematic processing of information
- symbol systems and representations
- algorithmic notions of flow control
- structured problem decomposition (modularizing)
- iterative, recursive and parallel thinking
- conditional logic
- efficiency and performance constraints
- debugging and systematic error detection

Some other authors prefer a simpler four main components of computational thinkings which can be abreviated as DAPA. 
- Decomposition
- Abstraction
- Pattern Recognition
- Algorithms

This notes will follow the later for simplicity and will try to apply these through Python programming language. Python is chosen for its simplicity but any other programming language can be used to build up your computational thinking skills.
