Previously, we discussed two sorting algorithms called [Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort]({% link _Notes/BubbleSort_InsertionSort.md %}). In this section we will apply our programming skills to investigate another sorting algorithm called the Heapsort. We will then compare the performance of Heapsort with the previous [Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort]({% link _Notes/BubbleSort_InsertionSort.md %}). We will discuss some notations on how to analyze these performance.

One reason why we introduce different sorting algorithms is to show you that there are many ways to solve the same problems. At the same time, these different ways may have different performances. After we introduce binary heap and heapsort algorithm, we will begin to introduce you how to analyze these different algorithms in terms of computation time. You will notice that Heapsort algorithm is a much better sorting algorithm as compared to Bubble sort and Insertion sort algorithms.

## Binary Heap

Before, discussing Heapsort algorithm, we have to introduce a new data structure called _binary heap_ or simply called _heap_. The heap is an array of object that we can view as a nearly perfect binary tree (or we can call it a _complete_ binary tree).

> A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree which **all** leaf nodes are at the same level. Complete binary trees are nearly perfect **except** the last level and all the leaves at the last level are packed towards the left.

You are familiar with the concept of array. But what is a binary tree? The easiest way to explain it is using some examples. The image below shows you an array of integers.

![Array of Integers Representing Binary Heap](/assets/images/week2/Binary_Heap_Array.png)

We have indicated the indices of each element in the array, which starts from 0. We can visualize the elements in this array in a form of a _tree_ as shown below.

![Binary Tree Satisfying Heap Property](/assets/images/week2/Binary_Heap.png)

A _tree_ in computer science is up-side down. It consists of _nodes_ and it has one _root_ node, which is at the top. In a _binary_ tree, each node has only _two_ children, which we will call the _left_ child and the _right_ child. Every node, except the root, has a _parent_ node. The node without children is what we called a _leaf_.

Let's take a look at the example above and put in all the terms we have mentioned:

- In the above tree, we have 10 nodes, where each node is each element in the array.
- The _root_ node is the element 16, which has an index 0 in the array.
- Node with element 16 (root node) has two children. The _left_ child is a node with the element 14, while the _right_ child is a node with the element 10.
- Elements 9, 3, 2, 4, and 1 are all _leaves_ because they do not have any children.
- The node with element 7 (index 4) has only one child, which is the node with element 1 (index 9).
- The node with element 1 (index 9) has node with index 4 as its _parent_.

Now, let's go back to our definition of a _heap_. The heap is an array of object that we can view as a nearly perfect binary tree.

- A binary tree is a tree where all the nodes have only a maximum of two children, which you can call _left_ child and _right_ child.
- A _full_ binary tree is a tree where all the nodes except the leaves have _two_ children. In our case, heap is a _complete_ binary tree and not a _full_ binary tree. A _complete_ binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is _completely filled_, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A _complete_ binary tree is similar to a full binary tree with two major differences: all the leaf elements must lean toward the left and the last leaf element may not have the right sibling.
- The _root_ of the tree is the node with index 0.
- We put the elements of our array into our _tree_ from top to bottom and left to right sequence. With this, we can calculate the index of the children and the parent for every node.

### Indices of Children and Parent in a Heap

Let's start by considering how to calculate the index of the parent node. Let's take a look at the example tree we have considered.

![Binary Tree Satisfying Heap Property](/assets/images/week2/Binary_Heap.png)

Note the following:

- The parent of node index 1 is 0. Similarly, the parent of node index 2 is also 0.
- The parent of node index 3 and 4 is 1, while the parent of node index 5 and 6 is 2.

How do we get index 0 from both indices 1 and 2? And how do we get index 1 from indices 3 and 4? Or index 2 from indices 5 and 6?

```
def parent(index):
Input: index of current node
Output: index of the parent node
Steps:
1. return integer((index-1) / 2)
```

We can test the above pseudocode. $(1-1)/2 = 0$ and $(2-1)/2 = 0$ for the second level nodes. Similarly, $(3-1)/2 = 1$ and $(4-1)/2 = 1$ for the third level nodes with the parent index 1. And $(5-1)/2 =2$ together with $(6-1)/2= 2$ for the third level nodes with the parent index 2. Note that we use _integer_ division to get the correct parent node.

In order to get the index of the _left_ child, let's observe the following:

- The left child of node 0 is index 1.
- The left child of node 1 is index 3.
- The left child of node 2 is index 5.
- and so on.

We can get the left child index using the following:

```
def left(index):
Input: index of current node
Output: index of the left child node
Steps:
1. return (index * 2) + 1
```

Test the above pseudocode and ensure it gives the correct left child nodes.

Similarly, we can observe the following for the indices of the _right_ child nodes:

- The right child of node 0 is index 2.
- The right child of node 1 is index 4.
- The right child of node 2 is index 6.
- and so on.

We can get the right child index using the following:

```
def right(index):
Input: index of current node
Output: index of the right child node
Steps:
1. return (index + 1) * 2
```

You can verify the above code yourself.

### Heap Property

There are two kinds of _heap_: max-heaps and min-heaps. In this case we will discuss only _max-heaps_. Both heaps must satisfy the **heap property**, which specifies the kind of heap we are dealing with. The **max-heap property** is specified as follows:

    For all nodes except the root:

    A[parent(i)] >= A[i]

This means that in a max-heap, the parent nodes are always greater that their children. This also implies that the largest node is at the _root_. The figure below is an example of a max-heap because it satisfies the condition above.

![Binary Tree Satisfying Heap Property](/assets/images/week2/Binary_Heap.png)

### Heapify - Maintaining the Heap Property

We will now describe an algorithm on how to maintain the _heap property_ and in this example is the _max-heap property_. We will call this procedures to maintain the _max-heap property_ as max-heapify. The idea is that for a given node, we will push down this node in such a way that the _max-heap property is satisfied_. This assumes that the _left_ child of the given node forms a tree that satisfies _max-heap property_. Similarly, the _right_ child of the given node forms a tree that satisfies _max-heap property_. The only part that does not satisfy the _max-heap property_ is the current node and its two children.

#### (P)roblem Statement

Given an index of a node in a binary tree, where the left and the right children of that node satisfies the _max-heap property_, restore the _max-heap property_ of the tree starting from the current node.

    Input: index of the current node in a heap
    Output: None
    Process: re-order the elements in the heap
             in such a way that the max-heap property is satisfied
             from the current index node.
    assumption:
        - left child forms a tree that satisfies max-heap property
        - right child forms a tree that satisfies max-heap property
        - current node with its children may not satisfy max-heap property

#### Test (C)ase

Let's take a look at the tree below.

![](/assets/images/week2/Heapify_1.png)

Note the following:

- The current node is index 1, which has the element of 4.
- The current with its children does not satisfy the _max-heap_ property because $4 < 14$ and $4 < 7$.
- The left child, i.e. tree starting from index 3 (elements 14, with children of 2 and 8), forms a tree that satisfies the _max-heap property_.
- The right child, i.e. tree starting from index 4 (element 7, with one children of 1), forms a tree that satisfies the _max-heap property_.

The procedure of _max-heapify_ will push the current node by swapping with the largest node along the way to satisfy the _max-heap property_. To do that, in the process of pushing the nodes, we will swap that node with the _largest_ child. In this way, we satisfy the _max-heap property_.

Let's look at the particular example above. Given the tree above, we do the folloing:

- We first find the largest child of the current node. The current node is element 4 (index 1). The largest child is element 14 (index 3), which is the left child of the current node.

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Heapify_1.png)

- We then swap the current node with the largest child, i.e. element 4 (index 1) with element 14 (index 3).

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Heapify_2.png)

- We, then, move our current index to the place where we swap, i.e. old index of element 14. So we are now at index 3.
- We do the same thing by looking if any of the children is larger than the current node. Since $8 > 4$, we swap 4 (index 3) with 8 (index 8).

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Heapify_3.png)

- We, then, move our current index to the place where we swap, i.e. old index of element 8. So we are now at index 8.
- Since this node has no more children, we stop. We can check whether the node has more children by calculating the index of the _left_ child and see if it is still within the length of the array minus one, i.e. $left(i) < n-1$, where $i$ is the current node index and $n$ is the number of element in the array.

#### (D)esign of Algorithm

We can write down the steps we did in the previous section as follows.

```
def max-heapify(A, i):
version: 1
Input:
  - A = array storing the heap
  - i = index of the current node to restore max-heap property
Output: None, restore the element in place
Steps:
1. current_i = i # current index starting from input i
2. As long as ( left(current_i) < length of array), do:
    2.1 max_child_i = get the index of largest child of the node current_i
    2.2 if array[max_child_i] > array[current_i], do:
        2.2.1 swap( array[max_child_i], array[current_i])
    2.3 current_i = max_child_i # move to the index of the largest child
```

Note that the above steps will continue iterating down even if the current node already satisfies _max-heap_ property. This means that we can stop iterating if the largest children is already less than the current node. We can do this by checking if any swap is happening. If no swap is needed then we are done. This is because we assumes that the left child and the right child already satisfies _max-heap property_.

```
def max-heapify(A, i):
version: 2
Input:
  - A = array storing the heap
  - i = index of the current node to restore max-heap property
Output: None, restore the element in place
Steps:
1. current_i = i # current index starting from input i
2. swapped = True
3. As long as ( left(current_i) < length of array) AND swapped, do:
    3.1 swapped = False
    3.2 max_child_i = get the index of largest child of the node current_i
    3.3 if array[max_child_i] > array[current_i], do:
        3.3.1 swap( array[max_child_i], array[current_i])
        3.3.2 swapped = True
    3.3 current_i = max_child_i # move to the index of the largest child
```

Note:

- We introduced a boolean variable called `swapped`. At every iteration, we set `swapped` to `False`.
- If there is a swap, we set this boolean variable to `True` and continues to the next iteration.
- If there is no swap, the boolean variable is still `False` and so it will stop the iteration.

### Building a Heap

We can then use the previous procedure _max-heapify_ to build a _binary heap_ data structure from any arbitrary array. The idea is to go through every nodes in the tree and _heapify_ them. However, we need not do for all the nodes, but rather only _half_ of those nodes. The reason is that we do not need to heapify the _leaves_.

We can show that the elements in the array from index $n/2$ to $n-1$ are all leaves. We do not need to push down these nodes as they do not have any children. So we can stry from element at position $n/2 - 1$ and move up to element at position 0.

#### (P)roblem Statement

Given an arbitrary array, re-order the elements in such a way that it satisfies _max-heap property_.

```
Input: any arbitrary array of integers
Output: None
Process: Re-order the elements such that the whole array satisfies max-heap property
```

#### Test (C)ases

Let's consider an array as shown below.

[1, 2, 8, 7, 14, 9, 3, 10, 4, 16]

- We first visualize this array as a binary tree as shown below. Note that this tree does not satisfy _max-heap property_.

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_1.png)

- We will start from the middle index, i.e. $n/2 - 1 = 10/2 - 1 = 4$, which is the fifth element, i.e. 14. Notice that all the elements after 14 are all _leaves_. We call _max-heapify_ on 14 and the result is a swap between 14 and 16. We only have one iteration because now 14 has reached the end of the array and cannot be compared with any other nodes. In the figure below, we indicate the next element to consider with a _dotted_ circle.

  [1, 2, 8, 7, **14**, 9, 3, 10, 4, 16]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_2.png)

  [1, 2, 8, 7, **16**, 9, 3, 10, 4, **14**]

- Now we move to the element on the left of 16, which is 7. The result of _max-heapify_ will swap 7 with 10.

  [1, 2, 8, **7**, 16, 9, 3, 10, 4, 14]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_3.png)

  [1, 2, 8, **10**, 16, 9, 3, **7**, 4, 14]

- Now, we move to the next element, which is 8. The result of _max-heapify_ will swap 8 with 9.

  [1, 2, **8**, 10, 16, 9, 3, 7, 4, 14]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_4.png)

  [1, 2, **9**, 10, 16, **8**, 3, 7, 4, 14]

- We move on to the next element, which is 2. The result of _max-heapify_ will swap 2 with 16, and then 2 with 14.

  [1, **2**, 9, 10, **16**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 14]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_5.png)

  [1, **16**, 9, 10, **2**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 14]

  and then,

  [1, 16, 9, 10, **2**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **14**]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_6.png)

  [1, 16, 9, 10, **14**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **2**]

- And now we move to the last element, which is 1. The result of _max-heapify_ will swap 1 with 16, and then 1 with 14, and finally 1 with 2.

  [**1**, **16**, 9, 10, 14, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_7.png)

  [**16**, **1**, 9, 10, 14, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

  next,

  [16, **1**, 9, 10, **14**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_8.png)

  [16, **14**, 9, 10, **1**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

  lastly,

  [16, 14, 9, 10, **1**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **2**]

  ![](/assets/images/week2/Build_Heap_9.png)

  [16, 14, 9, 10, **2**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **1**]

- Once it reaches the last element, the whole array now satisfies the _max-heap property_.

#### (D)esign of Algorithm

We can then write down the steps in a pseudocode as follows:

```
def build-max-heap(array):
Input:
  - array: arbitrary array of integers
Output: None, sort the element in place
Steps:
1. n = length of array
2. starting_index = integer(n / 2) - 1 # start from the middle or non-leaf node
3. For current_index in Range(from starting_index down to 0), do:
    3.1 call max-heapify(array, current_index)
```

Note:

- The pseudo simply says, we start from the middle node as our `starting_index`, and call the function max-heapify on that node.
- We then move to the left and continues calling max-heapify until we reach the first element at index 0.

## Heapsort

Now, we can consider Heapsort algorithm. The idea of a heapsort is pretty simple. For any arbitrary array, we can sort the integers in the array by first building a _max-heap_. Once the max-heap is built, we know that the maximum is at the _root_ node. With this, we can swap the _root_ node with the last element and then exclude it from our heap. We then should restore the _max-heap property_ after this swap because now the _root_ node will be a small number. We can do this repetitively until there is no more element in the heap.

### (P)roblem Statement

Given an arbitrary array of integers, sort the element using heapsort algorithm.

```
Input: array of integers
Output: None
Process: Sort the elements of the array in place using heapsort
```

### Test (C)ases

Let's use the same example as in the previous seciton. Let's say we have the following array.

[1, 2, 8, 7, 14, 9, 3, 10, 4, 16]

We will sort the elements following these steps:

- Build a max-heap from this array. The previous section has shown that the final output of building a max-heap will be:

  [16, 14, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 1]

- Now, we will swap the largest element with the last element, and exclude it from the heap. We will put the excluded element in what we called as `sorted`.

  heap = [**1**, 14, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4], sorted = [**16**]

- Notice, now, that the array does not satisfy the _max-heap property_. So we must _max-heapify_ the array to push the element 1 down to its place. The process of _max-heapify_ from the root node will result in:

  heap = [**1**, **14**, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4], sorted = [16]

  heap = [**14**, **1**, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4], sorted = [16]

  heap = [14, **10**, 9, **1**, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4], sorted = [16]

  heap = [14, 10, 9, **7**, 2, 8, 3, **1**, 4], sorted = [16]

- Once we have restored the _max-heap property_, we can take out the largest element from the first element and swap it with the last element in the heap.

  heap = [**4**, 10, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 1], sorted = [**14**, 16]

- We then _max-heapify_ the heap again to restore the _max-heap property_.

  heap = [**4**, **10**, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 1], sorted = [**14**, 16]

  heap = [**10**, **4**, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 1], sorted = [**14**, 16]

  heap = [10, **7**, 9, **4**, 2, 8, 3, 1], sorted = [**14**, 16]

- We then swap the largest element with the last element in the heap, and take it out from the heap.

  heap = [**1**, 7, 9, 4, 2, 8, 3], sorted = [**10**, 14, 16]

- The same process of _max-heapify_ happens again. We will now _remove_ the intermediate step and only show the first and the final state of the heaps.

  heap = [**1**, 7, 9, 4, 2, 8, 3], sorted = [**10**, 14, 16]

  heap = [9, 7, 8, 4, 2, **1**, 3], sorted = [**10**, 14, 16]

- We swap and take out again the largest element. The next iteration would be:

  heap = [**3**, 7, 8, 4, 2, **1**], sorted = [**9**, 10, 14, 16]

  then we max-heapify the array:

  heap = [8, 7, **3**, 4, 2, 1], sorted = [**9**, 10, 14, 16]

  Swapping and taking out the largest element:

  heap = [**1**, 7, 3, 4, 2], sorted = [**8**, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  and max-heapify:

  heap = [7, 4, 3, **1**, 2], sorted = [**8**, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  Swapping and taking out the largest element:

  heap = [**2**, 4, 3, 1], sorted = [**7**, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  and max-heapify:

  heap = [4, **2**, 3, 1], sorted = [**7**, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  Swapping and taking out the largest element:

  heap = [**1**, 2, 3], sorted = [**4**, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  and max-heapify:

  heap = [3, 2, **1**], sorted = [**4**, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  Swapping and taking out the largest element:

  heap = [**1**, 2], sorted = [**3**, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  and max-heapify:

  heap = [2, **1**], sorted = [**3**, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

  Swapping and taking out the largest element:

  heap = [**1**], sorted = [**2**, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

- At this point in time, the array is already sorted. If `heap` and `sorted` are not a separate array but rather one single array, we will have:

  result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16]

### (D)esign of Algorithm

Let's write down the steps in the previous section in a pseudocode.

```
def heapsort(array):
Input:
  - array: any arbitrary array
Output: None
Steps:
1. call build-max-heap(array)
2. heap_end_pos = length of array - 1 # index of the last element in the heap
3. As long as (heap_end_pos > 0), do:
    3.1 swap( array[0], array[heap_end_pos])
    3.2 heap_end_pos = heap_end_pos -1 # reduce heap size
    3.3 call max-heapify(array[from index 0 to heap_end_pos inclusive], 0)
```

Note:

- We first call the procedure in the previous section called `build-max-heap` to create the _max-heap_ data structure.
- We then start from the last element in the heap and swap it with the largest element (always at index 0).
- We reduce the variable `heap_end_pos` to reduce the heap size and exclude the largest element from the heap.
- Then, we can call `max-heapify` on a subarray. The subarray starts from index 0 of the current array up to index `heap_end_pos`. In this way, we exclude the largest element from being _max-heapified_.
- The second argument of `max-heapify` is the starting node where the process should begins. In this case, we always want to start `max-heapify` from index 0 because this is the node where we replace the largest element with some small element from the end of the heap.
