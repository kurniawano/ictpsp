## About Introduction to Computational Thinking and Problem Solving Using Python (ICTPSP)

This book introduces some of the basic concept in computational thinking and problem solving by learning to program using Python programming language. It is known that learning to code is one of the most effective way to train people in computational thinking. There are many aspect of computational thinking such as abstraction, decomposition, pattern recoginitin and algorithmic thinking. A key part of this is problem solving. In this book, we apply a problem solving framework called PCDIT on various programming problems. This framework can be used in various situations where bottom up approach is needed. 

One key aspect that differentiate computational thinking with other thinking skills such as mathematical thinking is that the solution to the problem can be carried out by a computing device or information-processing agent. Because of this such thinking process is closely coupled with the solution and how it is implemented. Though computational thinking can be taught without learning coding, in this book, we approach computational thinking in the context of learning programming using Python programming language. Since the programming language is used in the implementation of such solution, the solution and the thinking process is in a way affected by the choice of language up to a certain extent.
