## About Introduction to Computational Thinking and Problem Solving Using Python (ICTPSP)

This course provides fundamentals for students with the necessary skills in a data driven world. The first half of the course focuses on providing students with algorithmic thinking and different paradigms of computation such as procedural, object-oriented design and state machine. The second half of the course focuses on a basic introduction to machine learning for categorical and continuous data. Students will be able to apply both algorithms and basic machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems driven by data and computation.



## Prerequisite

This book assumes no prior knowledge of programming. Students are expected to be familiar on the use of basic computer operations.
